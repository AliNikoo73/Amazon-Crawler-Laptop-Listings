# 🛍️ **Automated Amazon Product Data Extraction for Machine Learning Analysis**

---

## 📜 **Summary**

This project involves the development of an **automated web scraper** that collects product data from Amazon, specifically focusing on **laptops**. The gathered information includes product titles, prices, and descriptions, which are stored in a **MongoDB** database for future machine learning analysis. 

The scraping process is automated using **Selenium**, which navigates Amazon’s interface, scrolls through pages, and clicks through product listings. Data is extracted from HTML elements using specific **locators** (e.g., class names, IDs) and is saved in **real-time** to MongoDB. This dataset can serve as the foundation for **machine learning tasks** such as **price prediction**, **product ranking**, and **sentiment analysis**. The goal of this project is to streamline data collection, making it scalable and efficient for future machine learning initiatives.
