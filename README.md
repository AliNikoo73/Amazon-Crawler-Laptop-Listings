# 🚗 **Web Scraping and Machine Learning on Second-Hand Car Listings from Divar.ir**

---

## 📜 **Summary**

This project involves developing a **machine learning model** to analyze second-hand car listings gathered from **Divar.ir**, a popular Iranian online marketplace. 

- **Web scraping** is done using **Selenium** to extract data, including car models, prices, and additional features.
- The data is stored in **MongoDB** and processed using **Pandas** and **NumPy** for further analysis.
- The machine learning model focuses on **price prediction**, **demand analysis**, and **market trends**. 

This project aims to provide **actionable insights** for car buyers and dealerships by predicting car prices, analyzing model trends, and offering a data-driven approach to understanding the second-hand car market.
